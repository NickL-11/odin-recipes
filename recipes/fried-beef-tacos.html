    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Lay 8 tortillas flat on a surface.</li>
        <li>Combine beef, taco seasoning, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Press 1/4 cup of beef mixture onto half of each tortilla.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4-inch of oil in a high-sided skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, carefully add one taco at a time, flat, to the hot oil.</li>
        <li>Hold empty side of the tortilla with a pair of tongs, and fold over beef filling once the shell is softened, about 5 seconds.</li>
        <li>Cook, turning once, until shell is golden brown and beef is no longer pink in the center, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side.. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately topped with onion and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, salsa, and hot sauce.</li>
